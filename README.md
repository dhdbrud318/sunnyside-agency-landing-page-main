# Frontend Mentor - Sunnyside agency landing page

![Design preview for the Sunnyside agency landing page coding challenge](./preview/preview.gif)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my work for the sunnyside agency landing page.

This project source is from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

This challenge focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle.
